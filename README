This repository is a random collection of OpenBSD related stuff (e.g.,
uncommitted diffs and new ports).

Be warned that any files found herein are very much a work-in-progress
and have received very minimal testing.  In some cases, I've done the
bare minimum to get things to compile even (and only on machines I
have easy access to).

That said, I'd like to see this code eventually get committed to CVS,
so any help cleaning things up would be greatly appreciated.
